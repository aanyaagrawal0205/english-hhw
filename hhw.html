<h3>Summer vacations are the best part of the year, a time when we break away from our usual routines to enjoy fun, relaxation,
 and new experiences.
This summer vacation was really wonderful and filled with lots of fun and relaxing moments. At the beginning of my break, 
I decided to finish some of my pending homework so that I would not have any problems at the end of the vacations. After that, I 
spent a lot of time with my family and friends. I attended some of my friends' birthday parties and had loads of fun. It was 
quite enjoyable and a great bonding experience for us.
<br>
One of the most exciting parts of my summer was when I went ice skating. I went there with my sister and my cousins, I fell twice 
at first and got a scratch but overall it was an unforgettable experiance. We also went on a trip to Dharamshala, where we did 
tons of new activities which were a new and exciting experience for me. I went ziplining, sky-cycling and held a rabbit for the 
first time! Rabbits are my favourite animals and I was delighted that I got the chance to hold one. We also saw beautiful sunsets and I went 
shopping and bought so many new clothes and accessories. I also got a few gifts for my friends. Throughout our travels, we met new people 
with different stories and perspectives, which made our experience even richer.
<br>
Aside from these adventures, I also made sure to relax and take some time for myself. I enjoyed my hobbies such as coding and 
sketching as well as making all kinds of crafts using the methods of paper-cutting and folding to decorate my bedroom. Doing 
these things helped me feel more relaxed and happy. I even tried something new, like paying the guitar, which turned out to be 
really fun and interesting. I will also continue to learn playing the guitar as it is a beautiful instrument. 
<br>
Overall, my summer vacation was a perfect mix of doing exciting things, spending time with loved ones, and 
taking time to relax. It gave me a lot of happy memories and made me feel refreshed and ready to go back to 
my regular routine. Iâ€™m already looking forward to next summer and all the adventures it will bring!
